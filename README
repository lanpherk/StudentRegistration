1. Please complile and run the ScholarshipClient class. I adapted your make file to compile and run with my database. You should be able to run with that. I am including a copy of my SQL database I hope I do this correctly. 

2. Reason why I chose the gateway pattern:

I chose the gateway pattern because it works well with my original design. Since I already had the objects loaded into an ArrayList I figured I could have this class return an arraylist instead of a map (as was suggested in the reading). This fits easily into my previous design, and I planned to add the functionality of the program by adding an application process, and I wouldn't have time to execute a complicated database interface and do that. In truth I also chose it because it is one of the easier patterns to implement, and this is my first time using any kind of database, so I already had a lot to learn there.
